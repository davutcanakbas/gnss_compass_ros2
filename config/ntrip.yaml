# NTRIP Client Configuration for RTK Corrections
# =============================================================================
#
# This file configures the NTRIP client to receive RTK corrections
# from an NTRIP caster (base station network).
#
# FINDING A BASE STATION:
#   Use the included script to find nearby free RTK2GO stations:
#   
#   ./scripts/find_rtk2go_stations.sh <your_lat> <your_lon>
#   
#   Example: ./scripts/find_rtk2go_stations.sh 52.52 13.40  # Berlin
#
# RTK REQUIREMENTS:
#   - Base station should be within 35-50 km for reliable RTK
#   - Clear sky view required for both rover and base
#   - Same GNSS constellations should be tracked

    # Initial position for GGA (used before GNSS fix is available)
    # Set to your approximate location, or leave as 0.0 to skip initial GGA
    # These are overridden once the driver provides actual position
    latitude: 0.0
    longitude: 0.0
